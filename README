This tar contains router and pktgen.

How to compile:
	By type "make" or "make router", you will compile router.
	By type "make pktgen", you will compile pktgen.
	By type "make all", you will compile both router and pktgen.

1. The router program will take three command-line arguments:
<port number to listen to> <routing table file path> <statistics file path>

The router program will: 
read its routing table from the specified file 
The file will consist of multiple lines with the format:  
<network‐address> <net‐prefix‐length> <nexthop>
The network‐address would be in IPv4 dotted decimal. The nexthop value would 0, RouterB or RouterC. The three values will be separated by spaces.
For example: 
192.224.0.0 16 RouterC 

A 0‐value of nexthop means a direct delivery of a packet to a host within network A. 
listen to the specified UDP port accept simplified IP packets of the format:  
<packet ID>, <source IP>, <destination IP>, <TTL>, <payload> 
Example: 215, 192.168.192.4, 192.224.0.7, 64, “Hello” 


2. The packet generator program will take two command‐line arguments: 
<port number to connect to router>  <packets file path> 

The program will:
create packets and set <packet ID>, <source IP>, <destination IP>, <TTL>, <payload>
sends packets to router program

Packets file: 
After every 20 packets are generated, it will update the packets file 
The format of the file will be: 
NetA to NetB: <number of packets generated with source host in Network A and destination host in Network B> 
NetA to NetC: <number of packets generated with source host in Network A and destination host in Network C> 
NetB to NetA: <number of packets generated with source host in Network B and destination host in Network A> 
NetB to NetC: <number of packets generated with source host in Network B and destination host in Network C> 
NetC to NetA: <number of packets generated with source host in Network C and destination host in Network A> 
NetC to NetB: <number of packets generated with source host in Network C and destination host in Network B> 
Invalid Destination: <number of packets generated with invalid destination >
